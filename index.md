# Introduction

This domain will investigate collaboration and conflict in online
communities. We will primarily be looking into behaviors on wikipedia;
its open-source culture and heavy usage make it an ideal subject of
study.

**Collaboration**

What constitutes successful collaboration on an online platform? Is it
production of quality content by those of the community? How is it
related to engagement with the platform? How are these concepts
quantified?

**Conflict**

What constitutes conflift on an online platform? Does it necessarily
impede collaboration? How do certain conflicts interact with the power
structures of the online community (and any surrounding communities)?
How to conflicts play out among certain sub-populations? How are all
these concepts quantified?

You will be **strongly encouraged** to pursue a Quarter-2 project that
studies the same data source (Wikipedia data), as such data typically
takes a lot of time to wrangle/understand.

## Result replication (introduction to topic)

We will delve into this area via the following primary paper:
* [Robert Sumi, Taha Yasseri, András Rung, András Kornai, and János
  Kertész. "Edit Wars in Wikipedia." 2011 IEEE Third International
  Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third
  International Conference on Social
  Computing.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3689)

Here, we will follow the authors' exploration into wikipedia edit
wars, study their definition of a statistic that encodes conflict, and
critically examine their claims. Beyond this specific paper, we will
study an extension of this result and responses to these claims:

* [Milena Tsvetkova,Ruth García-Gavilanes,Luciano Floridi,Taha
  Yasseri. "Even Good Bots Fight." 2017 PLOS
  ONE.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04285)
* [R. Stuart Geiger and Aaron Halfaker. "Operationalizing conflict and
  cooperation between automated software agents in Wikipedia: A
  replication and expansion of Even Good Bots Fight." 2017 Proceedings
  of the ACM on Human-Computer
  Interaction](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Operationalizing-conflict-bots-wikipedia-cscw-preprint.pdf)

The latter-half of Quarter 1 will introduce you to other topics to
inform possible avenues for further research:
* possible applications of NLP to ask related questions in the area,
* descriptions of other online platforms that could support similar
  questioning.

# Section Participation

Participation in the weekly discussion section is *mandatory*. Each
week, you are responsible for doing the reading/task assigned in the
[schedule](#schedule). Come to section prepared to ask questions about
and discuss the results of these tasks.

Each week, turn in answers to the weekly questions to Canvas. These
questions are meant to focus your work for the week and help prepare
you for discussion. If you have questions about your work, please ask
them in section or office hours (I will rarely comment on your
submission).

You are responsible for the entire weekly reading/task, even if
portions are not covered in the weekly questions. The weekly tasks are
the building blocks for the project proposals/assignments due at the
end of the quarter.
