# EDA and Quantifying Edit Wars

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* EDA: undstanding contributions to Wikipedia
* Defining the M-Statistic

## Reading

Please read the following:
* Edit Wars on Wikipedia Section 02 *carefully*. Really understand it
  and try to verify what you are reading in the data.
* Aaron Halfaker, R. Stuart Geiger, Jonathan T. Morgan, and John
  Riedl. "The Rise and Decline of an Open Collaboration System: How
  Wikipedia's Reaction to Popularity Is Causing Its Decline." American
  Behavioral
  Scientist. [[Link]](https://stuartgeiger.com/papers/abs-rise-and-decline-wikipedia.pdf)


## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:
* Calculate the M-Statistic for a single article with an 'edit war'
  (you may find script on [WikiWarMonitor](http://wwm.phy.bme.hu/) useful).
* Attempt an EDA on the light-dump data on the WikiWarMonitor website
  (you may fall back to a smaller wikipedia, like simple english, if
  needed). Your EDA should attempt to:
  - Orient the reader to what edit sequences look like in time and how
    they vary from article to article.
  - Bonus: do a preliminary analysis of the M-statistic on many articles.
  

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions:

* How is collaboration defined in Halfaker/Geiger?
* What article did you choose? What was the M-statistic?
* Give one observation from your EDA that was interesting. Be
  specific and give specific values!
* What was one difficulty that you encountered this week?
