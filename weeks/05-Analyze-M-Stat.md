# Understanding the M-Statistic

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* Calculating the M-Statistic
* Doing a data analysis on the M-Statistic.

**Note:** it's very important to work through this week's tasks (and
last week's as well). They serve as the base for everything that we
will work on going forward.

## Reading

Please read the following:
* Again, read Edit Wars on Wikipedia Section 02 *carefully*. Again,
  really understand it and try to verify what you are reading in the
  data.
* Read through Section III ('Other Indicators of Controversiality')
  and *verify* the observations in that section in the data.
* Read about the temporal aspects of editing articles by the same
  authors in [Dynamics of Conflicts in
  Wikipedia](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038869)
  

## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:
* Calculate the M-Statistic for all articles in the light-dump data.
* Analyze the M-statistic of all articles and incorporate this into
  your EDA. In Particuar, use this to address the issues discussed in
  Section III of the 'Edit Wars' paper.
* Among those articles with edit wars, calculate the M-Statistic as a
  function of time (or edit-number of the article). When does the
  M-Statistic go up in time? When does it go down in time? What is the
  correlation between an article's M-Statistic and various
  time-related variables (e.g. age of article, time since last edit,
  etc).

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions:

* In english and simple english wikipedias, give the 50/90/95/99
  percentile M-Statistic. (Think about how to explain the descrepancy
  -- though don't turn it in).
* Give an observation from your data analysis you found interesting
  (and tell me why it's interesting!)
* What was a difficulty you came across doing your work this week?
